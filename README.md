### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I spend most of my time these days writing proprietary software for GPUs. My current fascination is with CUDA's [cooperative groups API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cooperative-groups) - my latest tinkerings can be found in `Exclusive Scan` in my [Cuda-Projects](https://github.com/tywerbicki/Cuda-Projects) repository.
